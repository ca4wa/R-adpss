Description: This package provides the functions for conducting a trial with adaptive
  sample size determination. Such a trial consists of adaptive determination of sample size
  at an interim analysis and implementation of frequentist statistical test of
  a prefixed significance level. The required assumptions for the test statistics are
  independent and stationary increments and normality. Predetermination of adaptation rule
  is not required.
