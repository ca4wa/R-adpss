Description: This package provides the functions for planning and conducting a
  clinical trial with adaptive sample size determination with maximal statistical
  efficiency. Such a trial consists of adaptive determination of sample size
  at an interim analysis and implementation of frequentist statistical test at the
  interim and final analysis with a prefixed significance level. The required
  assumptions for the stagewise test statistics are independent and stationary
  increments and normality. Predetermination of adaptation rule is not required.
